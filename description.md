## Full-Stack Application Deployment and Management on Kubernetes

# Objective:
In this project, you will deploy a full-stack application on a Kubernetes cluster, which includes a Node.js backend, a MongoDB database, and an Nginx frontend. You will use Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, ConfigMaps for environment management, and Persistent Volumes for data storage. This project will provide hands-on experience in deploying, managing, and scaling a complete application on Kubernetes.


# Project Overview:
1. Application Structure:

Frontend:
An Nginx server serving a static website.

Backend:
A Node.js API server that connects to a MongoDB database.

Database:
A MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.

Step 1: Setup the Kubernetes Environment

# Start Minikube:
Set up Minikube with sufficient resources.
Verify that kubectl is configured correctly.

# Create a Namespace:
Create a separate namespace for this project to organize resources:
kubectl create namespace fullstack-app


Step 2: Containerize the Application
Frontend (Nginx):
Create a Dockerfile for the Nginx server that serves static files.
Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.




Step 2.5: Backend (Node.js):
Create a Node.js API server that connects to MongoDB.
Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Node.js application.
Use environment variables to configure the MongoDB connection string.
Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.

Database (MongoDB):
Use the official MongoDB image from Docker Hub.
Configure MongoDB to use a persistent volume for data storage.
Step 3: Create Kubernetes Manifests
Create Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims:

Create ConfigMaps: 
Deploy MongoDB:
Write a deployment manifest for MongoDB that uses the Persistent Volume and ConfigMap.
Expose MongoDB using a ClusterIP service.


Deploy Node.js Backend:
Write a deployment manifest for the Node.js API server.
Use a ConfigMap to manage environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, server port).
Expose the backend using a ClusterIP service.


Deploy Nginx Frontend:
Write a deployment manifest for Nginx.
Use ConfigMaps to configure Nginx, if necessary.
Expose Nginx using a NodePort service.
Step 4: Application Management
Scaling:
Scale the Node.js and Nginx deployments to handle more traffic using kubectl scale.
Monitoring:
Use kubectl logs to monitor the logs of each container.
Describe and inspect resources to ensure everything is running smoothly.
Port Forwarding:
Use kubectl port-forward to access the MongoDB service locally for debugging.
Interacting with MongoDB:
Connect to MongoDB using the Mongo shell to insert, retrieve, and manage data.
Rolling Updates:
Perform rolling updates on the Node.js and Nginx deployments to simulate application updates with zero downtime.
Step 5: Testing and Validation
Access the Application:
Use the NodePort service to access the frontend and ensure it connects correctly to the backend.
Verify the backend can interact with MongoDB.
Verify Data Persistence:
Restart the MongoDB Pod and verify that data is still present, ensuring that the persistent volume is functioning correctly.
Environment Variable Verification:
Verify that environment variables are correctly passed from ConfigMaps to the containers.
Load Testing:
Perform basic load testing by increasing the number of requests to the Node.js backend and observing the system's behavior.
Step 6: Documentation and Submission
Documentation:
Document each step, including:
Setting up the Kubernetes environment.
Creating and applying Kubernetes manifests.
Building and pushing Docker images.
Configuring and deploying the application.
Performing scaling, monitoring, and updates.
Testing and validation steps.
Screen recording and presentation :
You should create a five-minute presentation that covers all the steps and requirements of the project, explains your approach, and discusses the challenges you faced along with the solutions you implemented to overcome them.
GitHub Repository:
Push all manifests, Dockerfiles, and relevant code to a GitHub repository.
Ensure the repository is well-organized and includes a README file with instructions.
Submission:
Submit the documentation as a PDF or Markdown file along with the GitHub repository link.
Evaluation Criteria:
Correctness:
All components should be correctly deployed and configured.
The application should be accessible, and all services should communicate as expected.
Docker and Kubernetes Configurations:
Proper use of Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Persistent Volumes.
Effective use of environment variables and scaling features.
Documentation and Code Quality:
Clear, comprehensive documentation and well-structured codebase.
Proper use of Git for version control.
Application Functionality:
The application should perform as expected, including data persistence, environment variable configuration, and load handling.
